## Exploiting Limit Overrun Race Conditions

Suppose there is an e-commerce site that provides a discount coupon intended for one-time use. However, you can redeem this coupon multiple times or even indefinitely by exploiting race conditions.

**Exploit**

1. In Burp Repeater, copy the application's endpoint multiple times to trigger coupon redemption.
2. Create a tab group and send the group in parallel.

## Bypassing Rate Limits with Race Conditions

Suppose an application requires an OTP for actions, allowing only five invalid OTP attempts before locking the user for a limited time. This rate limit can be bypassed using race conditions.

**Exploit**

1. In Burp Intruder, create a custom resource pool with 10 or more concurrent requests.
2. Start the attack to potentially bypass the five-attempt rate limit by sending 10+ requests in a single packet.

## Exploiting Single-Endpoint Race Conditions and time-sensitive vulnerabilities

Suppose you request the `forgot password` endpoint to generate a reset password token for `attacker@mail.com`. Simultaneously, make another request for `victim@mail.com` and send both requests in a group tab using a parallel connection. If the endpoint is vulnerable to race conditions, it may send the victim's token to the attacker's email.

In Some cases, we might need to use different `session cookie+csrf token` for each user to exploit time sensitive vulnerabilities. Here is a lab for it.
